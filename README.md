Deep Carlsen

This project is being done as a part of SoC 2023, under the mentorship of Navyansh Mahla and Atishay Jain.

The project aims at building a chess engine model using Deep Learning unlike the traditional ways of brute force game theoretic algorithms. There are a lot of blogs, and research papers to study and implement them to build an efficient chess engine. There may be different algorithms to achieve the same. 

Week 1: We learnt about the basics of Python using Mosh's Tutorial and learnt Object Oriented Programming in Python

Week 2: We learnt the basics of Keras and TensorFlow

Week 3: We studied and analysed a research paper and reading materilas detailing different approaches to implementing a chess engine and choosing one to implement.

Week 4: Starting work on the model
